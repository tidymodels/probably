## Introduction

probably contains tools to facilitate activities such as:

* Conversion of probabilities to discrete class predictions.

* Investigating and estimating optimal probability thresholds.

* Calibration assessments and remediation for classification and regression models.

* Inclusion of _equivocal zones_ where the probabilities are too uncertain to report a prediction.

## Installation

You can install probably from CRAN with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("probably")
```

You can install the development version of probably from GitHub with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("tidymodels/probably")
```

## Examples

Good places to look for examples of using probably are the vignettes.

* `vignette("equivocal-zones", "probably")` discusses the new `class_pred` class that probably provides for working with equivocal zones.

* `vignette("where-to-use", "probably")` discusses how probably fits in with the rest of the tidymodels ecosystem, and provides an example of optimizing class probability thresholds.
