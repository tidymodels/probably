    Assigned data `cal_pred[[y_name]] - cal_pred$.pred` must be compatible with existing data.
    x Existing data has 100 rows.
    x Assigned data has 0 rows.
    i Only vectors of size 1 are recycled.
    Caused by error in `vectbl_recycle_rhs_rows()`:
    ! Can't recycle input of size 0 to size 100.
