# probably: Tools for Post-Processing Predicted Values

Models can be improved by post-processing class probabilities, by:
recalibration, conversion to hard probabilities, assessment of equivocal
zones, and other activities. 'probably' contains tools for conducting
these operations as well as calibration tools and conformal inference
techniques for regression models.
